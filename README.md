# Phúc Khang 📚

**Full-time learner (Student | Enthusiast | Asst. Researcher)**

I'm a uni student currently pursuing a B.Sc in Software Engineering at FPT University, with concurrent research work at [AiTA LAb](https://aita-lab.github.io/). I am passionate about almost anything that can get my brain riled up and will stop at nothing to find an answer. My fields of interest include Natural Language Processing, Federated Learning, and possible real-world applications for AI and ML. It gets me exicted to see new technologies being developed everyday that benefits the need of man-kind and I cannot fathom what might lie ahead.
